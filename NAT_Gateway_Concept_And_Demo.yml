NAT Gateway


A NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway enables instances in a private subnet to:
•	Access the internet
•	But NOT be accessed from the internet


Why do we need NAT gateway ??
In a typical VPC setup, instances in private subnets:
•	Cannot access the internet directly
•	Need to download updates, packages, or connect to public APIs
A NAT Gateway solves this by allowing only outbound access to the internet via a public subnet.


Note  You **must create the NAT Gateway in a 🟩 public subnet.

💡 Why?
Because a NAT Gateway needs:
•	Internet access to forward traffic from private subnets out to the internet
•	To work, it requires a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW), and only public subnets are connected to an IGW


Steps to create the NAT Gateway..
- Go to NAT Gateway section
- select create NAT Gateway
- Name to the NAT Gateway
- select availabilty Zonal here -- (cause -- we need to provide the granular control within a specific availability zone, adhering to subnet level settings.)
- select subnet here  -- select public subnet here (cause -- the IGW is attached in public subnet, that is why select Public subnet here)
- Allocate the EIP (Elastic IP here)
- And select create NAT Gateway


Note -- we need to edit the route table -- need to add the entry of NAT in private subnet..
(NAT will be creating in Public Subnet)
(add the entry of NAT in private route table)

- come to private route table
- edit/ select private route table
- click on route
- edit route -- add route
- in target -- select NAT (add your NAT ID here), in destination -- make entry as 0.0.0.0/0 (standard entry of NAT)
- save the changes..



  now we can see that we are able to connect with the internet for our private instance.. by the command -- ping google.com
  (do the bastion host from the public instance to private -- and attah the NAT to getting the internet connection to our private servers..)

from now we can get the internet connection
can download the packages
basically internet related things can be done here..
