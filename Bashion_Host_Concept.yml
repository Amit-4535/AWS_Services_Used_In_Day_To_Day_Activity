Bastion Host


The Basic Concept of Bastion Host is we are login on private instance throuh the public host.

A Bastion Host (also called Jump Server)


Steps to create the bastion host from public to private..

- Launched ec2-public instance inside the public subnet.. it contains the IG attached..

- Launched ec2-private instance in private subnet.. (private subnet or instance don’t have internet connections..)

- Now logged public instance on putty and given sudo access.. now I wanted to do the bastion of for my private instance of the public instance..

- Now logged in with winscp and copied key myfirstkey.pem to my local to ec2 instance.. and change the permission of myfirstkey.pem file by using 
   chmod 600 myfirstkey.pem

- Now permission is changed of the file, now we will try to make the connection, or get the private instance access with the bastion host by using the command
  ssh -i myfirstkey.pem ec2-user@PrivateIPofPrivateInstance

Note - With the bastion host option we are not getting the internet connection to our private instance..
      just we can login to the server and can work here..

      to getting the internet connection to our private instance -- we need to use the NAT gateway here..
