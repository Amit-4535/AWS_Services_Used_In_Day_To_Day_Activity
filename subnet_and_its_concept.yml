Creating the subnet as per the requirement..


In simple word the subnet means -- Subnet = Division of a big network into smaller networks

we are creating the multiple subnets inside the VPC (deviding the VPC and creating the subnets..)

we can create only 2 types of subnets..
- public subnet     - Has Internet Gateway, and Used for Web Servers, Load Balancers
- private subnet     - No direct internet, and Used for Databases, Internal Apps


now let us create the public and private subnet..

- now we have a VPC with CIDR block as 10.0.0.0/23 that means total we are having 512 IP's, now i want to split this VPC in to 2 subnets.
  public and private with holding equal IP's.. 256 for each..

steps to creat the subnets.
- go to subnet 
- select create subnet
- select your VPC
- name to the subnet like (DEMO_subnet)
- select availability zones
- mention the IPV4 CIDR for your subnet
  like (10.0.0.0/24)  - that means it is holding the 256 IP's
- create the subnet.

  i am following the same steps and creating one more subnet - as private subnet..

  the CIDR of the subnet as -- 10.0.1.0/24 -- that means it is holding another 256 ips from the VPC..

why we have selected 10.0.1.0/24?

because earlier subnet - 10.0.0.0/24 are now holded 256 ips, now this one block is already occupied, hence we used 10.0.1.0/24 -- that means this 
subnet will be starting from the 257 ip.


in the CIDR block -- each block will hold the 256 ips.. and the ips will be starting from the 0 (that means 1st ip in the 0th position and last ip in the 255th position)
