Internet Gateway


The main purpose of the Internet Gateway is..
- An Internet Gateway is attached to a VPC so that resources in public subnets can send and receive traffic from the internet.

Without an Internet Gateway:

Instances cannot access the internet
Users cannot reach your public servers


Things to remember --
- IGW works only with Public Subnets
- Private subnets do not use IGW directly



now let us create the internet gateway and will attach to the VPC..

- go to internet gateway and - Select create internet gateway
- name to the internet gateway
- create it 
- once created -- go the action
- select attach to VPC
- select your VPC and
- click on attach
