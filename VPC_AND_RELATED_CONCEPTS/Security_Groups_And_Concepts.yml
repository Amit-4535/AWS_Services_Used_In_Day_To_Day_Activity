Security Groups..


Note - Secuirity group is working for Instance level

Security Groups are virtual firewalls used to control inbound and outbound traffic for resources inside a VPC..

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), Security Groups are attached to instances (EC2), load balancers, databases, etc.

it decides -
- Who can enter the server
- Who can leave the server
- Which ports are open or closed

  
  
  This will be useful in 

- Prevents unauthorized access.

 Example -
- Allow SSH (Port 22) only from your office IP.
- Block all other IPs.


 Inbound Rules (Incoming Traffic)
- from which port the request will be coming in my network -- that we are deciding here..

 Outbound Rules (Outgoing Traffic)
- from which port the request will go out that we can decide here.. 


Note - Security group is stateful

- Stateful → If inbound is allowed, response automatically allowed.
- Default Deny → If rule not present, traffic is blocked.
- Instance Level → Applied directly to servers.
- Allow Rules Only → No explicit “deny” rules


  Steps to create the Security Group..

- select create Security Group
- Add discription if required
