Route Table 


- Route Table in a VPC is used to control how network traffic moves inside the VPC and outside to the internet or other networks.
- in simple -- Route Table = Rules that tell packets “where to go next.” (we are deciding that where the traffic must be go)

  Without a route table, the system doesn’t know where to send the traffic.

Note -- Each Subnet must be associated with a Route Table
You can have multiple route tables
Public and Private subnets usually have different route tables


Steps to create the Route table and subnet Association to the route tables..

- select create route table
- name to your route table
- select your VPC
- and just create it

now once the Route table is created, we need to assign the subnets to the route tables, below is the steps..

- go to route table
- select your route table
- go to subnet association tab
- edit subnet association
- select your subnet
- save the association


  now we have associated the subnets to the route table..
  now for accessing the internet by internet gateway we need to add the entry of IGW in public route table as public subnet is associated in this route table..

steps to add the internet gateway in public route table..
- go to route table
- select public route table
- go to route tab
- click on edit route
- click add route -- in drop down of target -- select internet gateway -- in the destination -- mention IP as -- 0.0.0.0/0 (standard entry of IGW)
- save the changes..
