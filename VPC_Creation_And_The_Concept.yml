VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network.

“A VPC is a logically isolated virtual network in the cloud where we launch and manage our resources securely with full control over IPs, routing, and security.”


Basically we have 3 types of the VPC

public cloud
private cloud 
hybrid cloud

1 ) Public VPC

A Public VPC is a VPC where resources can directly access the Internet.
Characteristics
Has Internet Gateway attached.
Instances get Public IPs.

Used for Web Servers, Load Balancers, Bastion Hosts.

2 ) Private VPC

A Private VPC (or Private Network inside VPC) is where resources cannot directly access the Internet.
Characteristics
No public IPs.
Used for Databases, Internal Apps, Backend Services.
Often uses NAT Gateway if outbound internet is needed.


3 ) Hybrid VPC

Connected to On-Premise Data Center using VPN or Direct Connect.
Used by enterprises migrating gradually to cloud.



Steps to create the VPC..

- go to VPC and select create VPC
- select vpc only
- name to the VPC
- select IPV4 and mention the CIDR block here..
- enter the CIDR block and create the VPC

  note - for 500 ips i am selecting the vpc as 10.0.0.0/23  -- it will come with the total 512 IP's in which 5 ips will be reserved..

Please use the below table while creating the CIDR..

| CIDR | Subnet Mask     | Total IPs | Usable IPs* |
| ---- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| /16  | 255.255.0.0     | 65,536    | 65,531      |
| /17  | 255.255.128.0   | 32,768    | 32,763      |
| /18  | 255.255.192.0   | 16,384    | 16,379      |
| /19  | 255.255.224.0   | 8,192     | 8,187       |
| /20  | 255.255.240.0   | 4,096     | 4,091       |
| /21  | 255.255.248.0   | 2,048     | 2,043       |
| /22  | 255.255.252.0   | 1,024     | 1,019       |
| /23  | 255.255.254.0   | 512       | 507         |
| /24  | 255.255.255.0   | 256       | 251         |
| /25  | 255.255.255.128 | 128       | 123         |
| /26  | 255.255.255.192 | 64        | 59          |
| /27  | 255.255.255.224 | 32        | 27          |
| /28  | 255.255.255.240 | 16        | 11          |


Note -- * Usable IPs = Total IPs − 5 (Cloud providers usually reserve 5 IPs per subnet)

the reserved IP's are allocated as below..
1. Network Address (First IP) - Identifies the network itself.
2. VPC Router - Used by AWS as the default gateway.
3. DNS Server - AWS internal DNS.
4. Future Use - Reserved by AWS for future networking features.
5. Broadcast Address (Last IP) - Traditionally used for broadcasting to all hosts.
